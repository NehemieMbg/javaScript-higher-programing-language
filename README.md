# Guess My Number
Fun little game where i'm showcasing my javascript DOM skills.

## The rules are simples
- Guess a number between 1 and 20
- Each time you're making an attempt with the wrong number your score is decreasing
- A message saying to low or to high will appear to help you out
- When you found the secret number your higher score will be displayed
