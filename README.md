# Guess My Number
Fun little game where i'm showcasing my javascript DOM & Events skills.

## The rules are simples
- Guess a number between 1 and 20;
- Each time you're making an attempt with the wrong number your score is decreasing by one.
- A message saying "too low" or "too high" will appear to help you out.
- When you found the secret number your higher score will be displayed.
